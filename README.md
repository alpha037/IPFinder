# IPFinder

IPFinder application using Java Swing and Java Networking.

Developed using Netbeans IDE 7.3.1 so the source code is inside src/ipfinder/IPFinder.java
and the JAR file is inside dist/IPFinder.jar


BUILD OUTPUT DESCRIPTION
========================

When you build an Java application project that has a main class, the IDE
automatically copies all of the JAR
files on the projects classpath to your projects dist/lib folder. The IDE
also adds each of the JAR files to the Class-Path element in the application
JAR files manifest file (MANIFEST.MF).

To run the project from the command line, go to the dist folder and
type the following:

java -jar "IPFinder.jar" 

To distribute this project, zip up the dist folder (including the lib folder)
and distribute the ZIP file.
